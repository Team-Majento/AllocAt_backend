Introduction--

The world is still reeling from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The reopening of offices
has not been normalized since there are several regulations and official guidelines that must be
followed at workplaces. As a solution, nowadays many businesses tend to follow a hybrid
workforce since it paves the way to encourage Working from Home (WFH). But sometimes
some employees are required to come to the office for urgent matters and complete the tasks that
are assigned to them. In such situations, facility executives must follow a tedious process of
going through data sheets and excel files to track the availability of workspace and allocate that
place with the relevant resources for that task. So, businesses need smart workplace optimization
applications when they are re-opening their companies because it will not only optimize the
workspace allocating process but also allow the managers and higher authorities to keep strict
supervision on the workstations.
Therefore, we thought of implementing a Smart Workspace Management System to Business
Management and employees which enables them to allocate their workspaces according to their
requirements beforehand they come to the office. In addition to that, when group of
companies use a shared workspace, this system will automatically allocate costs for each
company based on their resource usage and generate a detailed report using that information to
ensure optimum utilization of business resources.
